# Reykunyu Rust edition

[Reykunyu](https://github.com/Willem3141/navi-reykunyu) is written in JavaScript, with Node.js for the server-side and plain JS for the client-side. This repository ~~contains~~ will contain an experimental rewrite of the server-side search functionality in Rust. The aim is to improve performance, and to be able to use the search functionality in the browser (via WASM) as well for a future offline mode. (And to be an interesting way to learn Rust, of course.)
